# HackMyDino
## My personal hacks for the original Chrome Dino Game.
---
### What's that ?
This project is a JS hack for the Chrome Dinosaur game, when you don't have any WiFi or when you are on the [chrome://dino](chrome://dino) url.
### Why ?
Simply because I was bored. And because I wanted to do live again ([https://twitch.tomaru.dev](https://twitch.tomaru.dev) :3)
### How ?
In JavaScript, during my [Twitch lives](https://twitch.tomaru.dev), in a few days.
### Ok, how do we install it ?
Well, let's. Several solutions, either you launch Chrome and you mark in the URL `chrome://dino`, or you go to [https://chromedino.com](https://chromedino.com), you do "Control + Shift + I", you click on the "Console" tab, and you make a copy&paste of the content of "Hack.min.js". Press "Enter", and that's it !
### Thanks, but how do we use it ?
It's very simple.
By pressing the keys below on your keyboard, you can activate the hacks present in the code.
You can use the numeric keypad or the top numbered keys, pressing "shift" at the same time.
